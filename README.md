# HamStudy

This will eventually be an app that gives easy access to the US ham radio
exam tests. The intent is to tie it into a slack/irc/whatever bot using
something like [Hedwig](https://github.com/hedwig-im).

Right now it just parses the extra exam questions into a struct. There's a couple of helper methods right now but not much else yet.
